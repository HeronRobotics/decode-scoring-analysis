# Heron Scout
_By Heron Robotics, FTC Team 27621._



We made Heron Scout ([heronscout.me](https://heronscout.me)) to be the easiest and most informative tool available to FTC scouters in the DECODE season. If you have any questions or suggestions, reach out to [heronroboticsteam@gmail.com](mailto:heronroboticsteam@gmail.com) or `_randomletters` on Discord!
